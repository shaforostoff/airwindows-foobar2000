# foo_dsp_decrackle

A foobar2000 DSP component wrapping the Airwindows **DeCrackle** algorithm —
click and vinyl-crackle removal that leaves the rest of the audio alone.

The DSP maths is a direct port of `plugins/WinVST/DeCrackle/DeCrackleProc.cpp`
(the `processReplacing` path) and is verified **bit-identical** to it; see
[Verification](#verification).

* Targets **foobar2000 1.5 and later**, 32-bit and 64-bit.
* Builds with **CMake**, so any Visual Studio from 2017 15.7 onward works.
* No dependency beyond the foobar2000 SDK, which is downloaded automatically.
  No WTL, no ATL, no vcpkg, no 7-Zip.
* Statically linked CRT — nothing to install alongside it.

## Building a release package

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build_release.ps1
```

That configures and builds x86 and x64 in Release, runs both test suites, and
writes to `dist/`:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `foo_dsp_decrackle-1.0.0.fb2k-component` | The installable component, both architectures in one file |
| `foo_dsp_decrackle-1.0.0-symbols.zip` | PDBs — keep these, they are what makes a foobar2000 crash report readable |

Install by dragging the `.fb2k-component` onto foobar2000, or via
**File → Preferences → Components → Install…**

Inside the archive:

```
foo_dsp_decrackle.dll        32-bit, loaded by foobar2000 1.5 – 2.x (x86)
x64/foo_dsp_decrackle.dll    64-bit, loaded by foobar2000 2.x (x64)
```

foobar2000 ignores architecture folders it does not understand, so a single
file installs correctly on every version.

### Options

```powershell
# Build only 64-bit
.\scripts\build_release.ps1 -Arch x64

# Supported Windows 7 build (see the note below)
.\scripts\build_release.ps1 -Toolset v142

# Assume AVX2 - only if the playback machine definitely has it
.\scripts\build_release.ps1 -InstructionSet AVX2

.\scripts\build_release.ps1 -Clean -SkipTests
```

### Targeting Windows 7

The default `SSE2` baseline runs on anything that runs Windows 7, and the
static CRT means no Visual C++ redistributable is needed.

One caveat that is **not** about this project: from Visual Studio 2022 17.10
onward, the v143 toolset no longer supports Windows 7 as a target. For a
supported Windows 7 binary, build with the v142 toolset:

```powershell
.\scripts\build_release.ps1 -Toolset v142
```

v142 ships with Visual Studio 2019, or as the *MSVC v142 – VS 2019 C++ build
tools* individual component inside the Visual Studio 2022 installer.

---

## Building by hand

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/x64 -A x64
cmake --build build/x64 --config Release
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/x86 -A Win32
cmake --build build/x86 --config Release
```

The first configure downloads and unpacks
`https://www.foobar2000.org/downloads/SDK-2025-03-07.7z` into
`external/foobar2000_sdk` (checksum verified). CMake's bundled libarchive
reads `.7z`, so no external tool is needed.

To fetch the SDK on its own:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\get_sdk.ps1
```

or straight from CMake:

```bash
cmake -DFB2K_SDK_DEST=external/foobar2000_sdk -P cmake/fb2k_download_sdk.cmake
```

### CMake options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FB2K_SDK_DIR` | `external/foobar2000_sdk` | Where the SDK lives |
| `FB2K_SDK_AUTO_DOWNLOAD` | `ON` | Fetch it if missing |
| `FOO_DSP_STATIC_CRT` | `ON` | `/MT` instead of `/MD` |
| `FOO_DSP_LTO` | `ON` | `/GL` + `/LTCG` in Release |
| `FOO_DSP_ARCH` | `SSE2` | `SSE2`, `AVX` or `AVX2` |
| `FOO_DSP_WIN32_WINNT` | `0x0601` | Minimum Windows version |
| `FOO_DSP_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Build the verification harnesses |

---

## Parameters

Reachable through **Preferences → Playback → DSP Manager**; add *DeCrackle
(Airwindows)* to the active chain and press **Configure selected**.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Filter** | How dark the audio that replaces a click is, from bass-only to full range. Tune it to hide the transitions — full bass is not always the best setting. |
| **Window** | Width of the detection window, from very narrow to very wide. Also what the latency scales with. |
| **Thresld** | Lower catches more. Be careful about it triggering on actual music; that sounds bad. |
| **Surface** | 0 is off. Higher settings apply increasing treble filtering aimed at general surface noise in quiet passages. Not a plain lowpass — it responds to micro-crackle rather than to underlying high frequencies. |
| **Dry/Wet** | At exactly `0.000` this becomes **delta monitoring**: you hear only what is being removed. If music comes through, Thresld is too low. |

Chris Johnson's own description is in `Airwindopedia.txt` under *DeCrackle*.

Moving a slider takes effect immediately on the playing audio without
restarting the DSP (via `dsp_v3::apply_preset`), so there is no gap or click
while adjusting.

**This DSP is not zero latency.** It reports its group delay to foobar2000, so
visualisations stay in sync. At the default Window setting it is about 1.1 ms
at 44.1 kHz, growing to roughly 9 ms with Window at maximum.

## Performance

`decrackle_verify` reports this, best of five passes over 30 s of 44.1 kHz
stereo, Release, on a modern desktop:

| Build | | scalar | SSE2 | speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| x64 | defaults | 57.2 ms | 46.3 ms | 1.24× |
| x64 | Surface off | 45.9 ms | 34.5 ms | 1.33× |
| x86 | defaults | 90.9 ms | 80.2 ms | 1.13× |
| x86 | Surface off | 52.1 ms | 41.4 ms | 1.26× |

That is ~650× realtime for the default x64 build — 0.15 % of one core. On a
2014 MacBook Air (1.4 GHz Haswell) expect roughly a third of that, so still
well under 1 %, and far below what the decoder itself costs. Memory is about
64 kB per stereo pair.

### Vectorization

The inner loop has three kinds of dependency, and only one of them is
exploitable:

* **Across samples** — fully recursive (six-pole IIRs, the `iirClick` attack
  and release ramps). Nothing to vectorize.
* **Across the six poles** — each pole feeds the next within the same sample.
  Also serial.
* **Across L and R** — completely independent apart from two cross-terms.
  **This is the 2-wide SSE2 opportunity**, and it is what `runStereoSSE2`
  exploits: L in the low lane, R in the high lane. The delay lines are already
  stored as interleaved `{l, r}` pairs, so each read is a single 16-byte load.

Because this is *lane parallelism* and not reassociation — same operations,
same order, same associativity, no FMA contraction — packed IEEE-754 doubles
round exactly like scalar ones. The harness asserts
`worst deviation vector vs. scalar path: 0.000e+00`, verified under
`/arch:SSE2`, `/arch:AVX` and `/arch:AVX2`.

Two things stay scalar because they genuinely are serial: the rectified
control band (one value derived from `L*R`, then six serial poles) and
`sin()`, of which there are two per sample when Surface is engaged. MSVC does
not ship a packed `sin`, and a polynomial approximation would forfeit
bit-exactness for a couple of percent — not a trade worth making. That is why
the Surface-off column shows the larger speedup.

**AVX and AVX2 buy nothing here.** A 256-bit register holds four doubles but
there are only two lanes of real parallelism, and the sample-to-sample
recursion rules out processing two samples at once. Measured, AVX2 lands
within noise of SSE2. FMA would change results (single rounding instead of
two) and break the bit-exactness guarantee for no measurable gain. `SSE2` is
therefore the default and there is no reason to change it.

### Other differences from a straight transcription of the VST

* **Coefficients are computed once per parameter change**, not once per buffer.
  The VST does ten `pow()` calls per `processReplacing` call.
* **`pow(x, 3.0)` becomes `x*x*x`** in the click detector, twice per sample.
* **`pow(2, expon + 62)` and `frexpf` in the dither** become bit manipulation
  on the float's exponent field. Exact, no libm call.
* **The Surface block is skipped entirely when Surface is 0**, which is where
  the two `sin()` calls per sample live. The VST computes them regardless and
  then discards the result.
* **The L and R delay lines are interleaved**, halving the number of cache
  lines the inner loop touches — they are always read at identical indices.
* **Dead code removed**: `prevSampleL/R` and `prevSurfaceL/R` are computed by
  the VST but never used.
* **Flush-to-zero is enabled** for the duration of each chunk (FTZ only; DAZ
  lives in a bit that early SSE2 parts treat as reserved).

None of these change the output — see below.

## Verification

```bash
ctest --test-dir build/x64 -C Release --output-on-failure
```

**`decrackle_verify`** compares the port against
`tests/decrackle_reference.h`, a verbatim copy of the Airwindows VST source
used as an oracle. Across 12 parameter/sample-rate combinations × 5 signal
types, fed in 1024-sample chunks so buffer boundaries are exercised, the worst
deviation is **0.000e+00** — bit-identical, on both x86 and x64. It also:

* feeds NaN, ±infinity, `1e30` and denormals in and checks the output stays
  finite and that clean audio afterwards comes back clean;
* sweeps every parameter across 21 steps × 14 sample rates from 1 kHz to
  20 MHz, checking buffer indices stay in bounds and nothing diverges;
* checks the single-channel path against a duplicated-stereo run;
* reports throughput.

**`component_smoke`** loads the built DLL exactly as foobar2000 does — through
`foobar2000_get_interface()` and the service factory list — then registers the
DSP, instantiates it from a preset and pushes audio through it: format changes
mid-stream (stereo → mono → 5.1 → 192 kHz), `flush()`, live preset changes, and
truncated/empty stored presets. It also opens the configuration dialog for
real, moves a slider, and checks that the live update fires and that Cancel
restores the original preset. It skips itself if no matching-architecture
foobar2000 is installed (it needs `shared.dll`); set `FOOBAR2000_DIR` to point
at one.

To eyeball the dialog without installing anything:

```bash
build\x64\tests\Release\component_smoke.exe ^
  build\x64\foo_dsp_decrackle\Release\foo_dsp_decrackle.dll ^
  --screenshot dialog.bmp
```

### Deliberate behavioural differences

Two places where the port does not follow the VST, both to avoid producing
garbage:

1. **Filter coefficients are clamped to ≤ 1.0.** `filterOut` and `filterRef`
   are divided by `sampleRate / 44100`, so below roughly 22.7 kHz they exceed 1
   and the recursion diverges to infinity. The VST has the same flaw; it just
   never gets handed a 22 kHz file. At 44.1 kHz and above the unclamped values
   never exceed 0.52, so the clamp cannot alter normal playback.
2. **Input is sanitised.** Samples that are NaN, infinite or above `1e30` are
   replaced with silence before they can lodge themselves in the recursive
   state. Real audio is untouched. Delay-line indices are additionally clamped
   into range, which only ever matters at absurd sample-rate/Window
   combinations.

The dither generator is also seeded with fixed constants instead of the VST's
`rand()`, so the same file renders to the same bits every time — which matters
for a player that can also be used as a converter.

## How multichannel is handled

DeCrackle's click detector correlates left against right, so channels are fed
to it in their natural stereo pairs (front L/R, side L/R, back L/R, and so on),
read out of the chunk's channel map. Channels with no partner — centre, LFE,
back centre — go through a degenerate single-channel path where the cross
detector collapses to `x²`. A chunk with an unrecognised channel map falls back
to pairing in interleave order.

```

`decrackle_core.{h,cpp}` deliberately knows nothing about foobar2000, VST or
Win32, which is what lets the test harness compare it against the original
source directly.

---

## Known limitations

* **No dark mode.** The configuration dialog is plain Win32. Following
  foobar2000 2.x's dark mode means `fb2k::CDarkModeHooks`, which pulls in
  libPPUI and WTL — WTL is not in the SDK archive and would have to be
  downloaded separately. The dialog was kept dependency-free instead.
* **The tail is not flushed.** Like the VST, the last few milliseconds sitting
  in the delay line at end of playback are not emitted. Flushing them would add
  samples to the stream and break gapless playback.
* **ARM64EC is wired up in CMake but untested.**
