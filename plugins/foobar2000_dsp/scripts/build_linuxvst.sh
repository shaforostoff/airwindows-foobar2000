# Builds the LinuxVST ports of Declick and Dehum into loadable .so plug-ins.
#
# Produces:
#
#     plugins/dist/linuxvst/Declick.so
#     plugins/dist/linuxvst/Dehum.so
#
# This is the counterpart of scripts/build_winvst.ps1, and the same two things
# about it are worth knowing before reading it.
#
# It does not use plugins/LinuxVST/CMakeLists.txt. That project builds all five
# hundred plug-ins and wants Steinberg's vst2.x sources dropped into
# LinuxVST/include/vstsdk, which are not redistributable and are not in this
# repository. Rather than change the CMake project - which is what anyone who
# does have the SDK uses, and which now carries add_airwindows_plugin(Declick)
# and add_airwindows_plugin(Dehum) lines like every other plug-in - this drives
# the compiler over the two plug-in folders directly.
#
# It compiles plugins/WinVST/vst2_shim in place of the SDK. That folder is named
# for where the Windows port put it; what is in it is the VST2 ABI, and the ABI
# is not a Windows thing - the AEffect layout, the opcode numbers and the
# calling convention are the same here, which is the whole reason one plug-in
# source tree can serve hosts on both platforms. Read
# plugins/WinVST/vst2_shim/README.md for what the shim is and, more to the
# point, what it does not prove.
#
# Unless --skip-tests is given, two of the harnesses in tests/ are built and run
# against what came out. They are the same two the Windows build runs, and on
# this platform they are the only way to run them at all: the CMake project in
# plugins/foobar2000_dsp builds a foobar2000 component and stops at a
# FATAL_ERROR anywhere but Windows.
#
#   <plugin>_vst_verify   drives the core directly with the same Config and
#                         requires the wrapper's processDoubleReplacing output
#                         to match it to the bit, plus everything the wrapper
#                         has to get right on its own - block patterns, the
#                         latency contract, resume(), the slider mappings, the
#                         preset chunk. Links the plug-in; cannot see the ABI.
#   vst_host_verify       loads the finished .so the way a host does - dlopen,
#                         the entry point, opcodes, the function pointers in
#                         AEffect - and requires its audio to match the same
#                         plug-in linked statically, to the bit. That is the one
#                         that sees the ABI.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build_linuxvst.sh                  both plug-ins, both harnesses
#   scripts/build_linuxvst.sh Dehum            just the dehummer
#   scripts/build_linuxvst.sh --skip-tests     build only; not recommended, and
#                                              on this platform there is no
#                                              other way to run either harness
#   scripts/build_linuxvst.sh --clean          wipe the object directory first
#
# Environment:
#   CXX      the compiler. g++ by default; "g++ -m32", with multilib installed,
#            builds a 32 bit plug-in - set OUTDIR as well in that case so it
#            does not overwrite the 64 bit one.
#   OUTDIR   where the .so files go. plugins/dist/linuxvst by default.

# Deliberately not a copy of what the LinuxVST CMake project uses - that is
# "-O2 -D__cdecl=", and the define is for a spelling in Steinberg's headers that
# the shim does not use. What is here is what matters for something another
# program is going to load:
#
#   -fPIC                       a shared object has no choice
#   -fvisibility=hidden, and the version script written below: the only symbols
#                               this .so exports are the entry point and its
#                               legacy alias. Some hosts dlopen with
#                               RTLD_GLOBAL, and one that does would otherwise
#                               get the plug-in's whole C++ surface, and its
#                               copy of libstdc++'s, in the global namespace.
#   -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc
#                               the same call /MT makes on Windows: a plug-in
#                               linked against this machine's libstdc++ would
#                               refuse to load on a distribution with an older
#                               one, and the user's host is where they would
#                               find that out.
#   -Wl,--no-undefined          a symbol the shim does not define is a link
#                               error here, not a dlopen failure later.
#   no -ffast-math, ever        it changes the arithmetic, and the bit
#                               comparisons in vst_host_verify are what say the
#                               ports are running the same DSP.
