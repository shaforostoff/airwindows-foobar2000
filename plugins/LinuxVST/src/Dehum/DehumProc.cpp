/*  There is no per-sample DSP written out here, and that is deliberate: the
 *  algorithm is an FFT-based line detector feeding a bank of heterodyne
 *  notches, and it lives in dehum_core.cpp so that the foobar2000 DSP, the
 *  offline CLI and this plug-in are all running the identical code. What
 *  belongs in this file is only what a VST has to do that the others do not:
 *
 *    - notice sample rate and slider changes, since a VST is told about
 *      neither (updateConfig(), in Dehum.cpp),
 *    - dither on the way down to 32 bit float.
 *
 *  Handing the host n samples out for every n in - the third item in the
 *  equivalent Declick file - is not a problem here, because this core has no
 *  latency and works in place. The detector reads the signal but does not sit
 *  in the path, so there is no lookahead to pre-roll, no FIFO, and nothing to
 *  flush at the end of a bounce.
 *
 *  The blocks below exist only because the DSP is done in double while the
 *  float path has to dither on the way out: the scratch buffers are where the
 *  doubles live in between. Splitting a long buffer across several calls is
 *  something the core cannot detect - process() is a plain per-sample loop with
 *  its own hop counter - which is what dehum_verify's block size invariance
 *  check establishes.
