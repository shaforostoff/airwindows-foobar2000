/* ========================================
 *  dehum_vdj_verify
 *
 *  Same shape as declick_vdj_verify, plus the one thing Dehum has that Declick
 *  does not: a scout. See dehum_vdj_scout.h - it is the reason the buffer
 *  plug-in is worth having for this core, which has no latency and therefore
 *  nothing to gain from readahead as such.
 *
 *  What is pinned here:
 *
 *  1. That BufferPipeline hands back exactly what the core produces running
 *     straight through the song, at any block size. Dehum has no lookahead, so
 *     this is a weaker claim than Declick's - but the cache and the position
 *     arithmetic are the same code, and this is the cheaper place to catch a
 *     mistake in them.
 *
 *  2. That the scout finds the line, at the frequency it is actually at, and
 *     that it spends the budget it says it spends.
 *
 *  3. The slider mappings, against dehum::Params::defaults() and the VST2 port.
 *
 *  Not tested here: the detector and the notch. dehum_verify in
 *  ../../foobar2000_dsp/tests does that, and this binary compiles the identical
 *  core.
