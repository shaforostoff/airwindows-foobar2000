/* ========================================
 *  declick_vdj_verify
 *
 *  What this pins, in order of how much it matters:
 *
 *  1. The readahead claim. BufferPipeline says the audio it hands back is what
 *     the core would have produced running straight through the song, aligned
 *     with what was asked for and with no delay - which is the entire reason
 *     the buffer plug-in exists rather than only the live one. reference()
 *     below runs the core directly, with no cache and no position arithmetic,
 *     and the pipeline has to match it to the bit.
 *
 *  2. That the block size does not matter. VirtualDJ picks nb; nothing about
 *     the result may depend on it.
 *
 *  3. That jumping about is consistent. A DJ scratches, so the same song
 *     position gets asked for repeatedly and out of order, and a sample heard
 *     twice has to sound the same both times.
 *
 *  4. The slider mappings, against declick::Params::defaults() and against the
 *     VST2 port's paramsFromControls(). A slider position has to mean the same
 *     thing in every port.
 *
 *  Not tested here: the declicking itself. declick_verify in
 *  ../../foobar2000_dsp/tests does that against a Python reference, and this
 *  binary compiles the identical core.

//! missed too and restarted it again. With a warm-up invented by the pipeline
//! rather than asked of the engine, that was 22000 frames of Declick per 512
//! frames of audio, and it stuttered until the scout finished.
