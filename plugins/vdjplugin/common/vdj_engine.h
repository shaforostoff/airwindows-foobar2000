/* ========================================
 *  vdjplugin - the shape both wrappers drive
 *
 *  VirtualDJ has two audio plug-in interfaces and this project uses both, so
 *  each DSP core is wrapped once and driven twice. What the two wrappers agree
 *  on is this file: an engine is a stereo push/pull pipeline in double, with a
 *  known lookahead, and it knows how to put its own sliders on the host.
 *
 *  Doubles rather than the floats VirtualDJ hands over, and rather than the
 *  shorts the song buffer holds, because both cores compute in double and every
 *  other port of them - foo_dsp_*, the VST2s, the Audio Unit - converts at the
 *  edge for the same reason: it is the only way the verification harnesses in
 *  ../foobar2000_dsp/tests can compare one port against another to the bit.
 *
 *  Push/pull rather than in-place even though Dehum has no latency and does
 *  work in place, because Declick holds Config::latency samples and the
 *  wrappers should not have to know which core they are carrying. Dehum pays
 *  one memcpy through Fifo below for that, which is nothing next to an FFT.
